### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

* I am a programmer who enjoys writing neat stuff. Since the start I have always held an interest in technologies such as robotics, internet, machines, ai, etc from childhood.


* My experience of programming had started in August 2017 and I had continue thrived on as the years go by.

* One thing programming had taught me is persistence and passion. If you don't have those two things you're not all set.

* I'm looking forward to create more projects in future in other programming languages that involve machine learning, ai and maybe some game development included.

#### Languages I'm interested in or already know:
* C++, C, Python, Go, Nim, Javascript, Java
#### Projects known for
* As of now is [Dimscord](https://github.com/krisppurg/dimscord), which took me months to develop with a help of few people I know.
